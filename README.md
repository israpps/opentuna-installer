# OpenTuna installer

This is the OpenTuna installer. This will install OpenTuna hacked icons and APPS folder on PS2 consoles with ROMs ranging from versions 1.10 to 2.30 (2.50?). This means OpenTuna is now compatible with Fat and Slim models from SCPH-18000 up to SCPH-90010 and PS2-TV.




##### note:

the following folders will be deleted from the memory card to avoid issues:

- `APPS`
- `FORTUNA`
- `OPENTUNA`
